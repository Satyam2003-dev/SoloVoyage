                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Your safety must come first when meeting someone new. Always choose a public, populated, and neutral location for first meetings.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Safe Meeting Spots:</strong> Opt for busy coffee shops, popular restaurants, hotel lobbies, or public parks during daytime hours. These places have witnesses and staff who can help if needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Locations to Avoid:</strong> Never agree to meet someone for the first time at their home, your accommodation, or any secluded, private location. Decline any suggestions to move to a "quieter" spot.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintain Independence:</strong> Arrive and leave using your own transportation. Do not depend on a new acquaintance for a ride, as this gives them control over your movement.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Before you meet someone new, inform a trusted contact of your plans. This person is your safety check-in.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Share Key Details:</strong> Tell your contact the name of the person you're meeting, where you are going, and what time you plan to be back. If possible, share a photo of the person from their dating profile or social media.</li>
                        <li><strong>Establish a Check-in Time:</strong> Arrange a specific time to text or call your contact after the meeting is over to let them know you're safe.</li>
                        <li><strong>Have a Backup Plan:</strong> Agree on what your contact should do if you do not check in as planned (e.g., wait 30 minutes, then call your hotel, then contact local authorities).</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>If someone makes you uncomfortable, that's all the reason you need to remove yourself from the situation. Don't second-guess your gut feeling.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Red Flags:</strong> Be wary of people who ask too many personal questions too quickly (about money, where you're staying), ignore your boundaries, or try to isolate you from others.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't Worry About Being "Nice":</strong> Many people, especially women, are conditioned to be polite. Your safety is more important than someone else's feelings. It is okay to be rude to be safe.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create an Exit:</strong> If you feel uneasy, you don't need a dramatic excuse. Simply say, "It was nice meeting you, but I have to go now," and leave confidently.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Keep some details private until you know someone better and have established trust over time.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Protected Information:</strong> Your exact accommodation address, room number, full travel itinerary, and financial situation are private. Do not share them freely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Be Vague:</strong> When asked where you're staying, you can name the neighborhood rather than the specific hotel. If asked about your plans, you can speak in general terms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build Trust Gradually:</strong> As you get to know someone over several meetings in public places, you can decide if you feel comfortable sharing more specific details.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Group activities are a fantastic and inherently safer way to meet other travelers and locals than one-on-one encounters.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Safety in Numbers:</strong> Being in a group provides a natural safety net. You're surrounded by other people and usually led by a professional local guide.</li>
                        <li><strong>Structured Environment:</strong> Activities like city walking tours, cooking classes, or day trips are structured, reducing the chance of ending up in an unsafe situation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Observe Social Dynamics:</strong> A group setting allows you to observe how people behave before you consider spending time with them individually.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Never go to someone's home on first meetings, regardless of how well you think you know them from online interactions.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>First Date Rule:</strong> The first date should always be in a busy, public place, ideally during the daytime. A coffee date is a perfect, low-pressure option.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Private Locations:</strong> Do not let a date persuade you to go to their apartment, a secluded park, or any private location. If they are pushy about this, it is a major red flag.</li>
                        <li><strong>Arrange Your Own Transport:</strong> Always have your own way to get to and from the date. Do not rely on them for a ride home.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Tell a friend or family member where you're going when meeting someone for romantic purposes. This is a non-negotiable safety step.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Share All Details:</strong> Provide your contact with the person's name, a screenshot of their profile, the exact location of the date, and the time you're meeting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Live Location Sharing:</strong> For an extra layer of safety, consider sharing your live GPS location with your trusted contact for the duration of the date.</li>
                        <li><strong>Post-Date Check-in:</strong> Always remember to text your contact when you have safely returned to your accommodation after the date.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Don't depend on dates or new friends to get you home safely. Maintaining control over your own transportation is essential.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Transportation Independence:</strong> Research public transport options to and from meeting locations, and have trusted local taxi or ride-sharing apps ready on your phone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decline Rides:</strong> Politely decline offers for a ride home from someone you've just met. This maintains your independence and prevents you from being in a vulnerable situation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Have Emergency Cash:</strong> Always keep enough cash hidden away specifically for an emergency taxi ride home, just in case your phone dies or apps aren't working.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>A quick video call can help you verify a person's identity and get a feel for their personality before committing to a face-to-face meeting.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Verify Identity:</strong> A video chat confirms that the person matches their online photos and is not a "catfish."</li>
                        <li><strong>Gauge Comfort Level:</strong> This is a great way to assess their communication style and your comfort level with them. You can learn a lot from a 5-minute conversation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Red Flag Alert:</strong> If a person is hesitant or makes excuses to avoid a video call, be very cautious. This is often a red flag.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Evening meetings can wait until you know someone better and have established a foundation of trust.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Daylight Advantage:</strong> Daytime meetings are inherently safer due to better visibility and more people being around. They also tend to be more casual and less pressure-filled.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build Trust:</strong> Use one or two successful, comfortable daytime meetings as a prerequisite before even considering an evening meeting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Public and Well-Lit:</strong> If you do transition to an evening meeting, ensure it is in a very public, well-lit, and reputable location that you are familiar with.</li>
