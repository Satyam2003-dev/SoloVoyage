                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>High customer turnover usually indicates fresh food and reduces your risk of foodborne illness.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Follow the Locals:</strong> A restaurant that is consistently busy with local patrons (not just tourists) is a strong indicator of quality and safety.</li>
                        <li><strong>Signs of Freshness:</strong> High turnover means ingredients are being used quickly and not sitting around for long periods, which is key to avoiding food poisoning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Observe Cleanliness:</strong> Take a quick look at the general hygiene of the establishment—clean tables, floors, and staff are all positive signs. If a place looks dirty, trust your gut and leave.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Street food can be delicious and safe, but it requires careful selection to avoid illness.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Made to Order:</strong> Choose vendors who cook the food fresh right in front of you. Ensure it is served piping hot, as high temperatures kill most harmful bacteria.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Risky Items:</strong> Be wary of food that has been sitting out for a long time, raw or uncooked items, pre-cut fruits, and anything containing un-refrigerated dairy or mayonnaise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hygiene Check:</strong> Observe the vendor's practices. Do they handle money and food with the same hands? Is their cart and preparation area clean? Choose vendors with high standards.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>In areas with questionable water quality, sealed bottled water is your best defense against serious illness.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Check the Seal:</strong> Always ensure the cap on a bottle of water is factory-sealed. Some vendors in tourist areas are known to refill old bottles with tap water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Ice and Raw Veggies:</strong> Say no to ice in your drinks and be cautious of raw salads, as both are often prepared with local tap water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use for Brushing Teeth:</strong> If the tap water is not safe to drink, it is also not safe for brushing your teeth. Use bottled water for this purpose as well.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Observing food preparation helps you identify potential health risks before you eat.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Look for Good Practices:</strong> Watch for clean cooking surfaces, separate utensils for raw and cooked foods, and staff who wash their hands frequently.</li>
                        <li><strong>Red Flags:</strong> Be cautious if you see a cook using the same knife on raw meat and then on vegetables, if food is stored at room temperature, or if there are flies around the preparation area.</li>
                        <li><strong>Open Kitchens are a Good Sign:</strong> Restaurants and stalls with open kitchens that are proud to show their preparation methods are often a safer bet.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Fruits with a thick, removable peel significantly reduce your risk of consuming contaminated water or bacteria.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Safe Choices:</strong> Bananas, oranges, mangoes, pineapples, and avocados are excellent choices because you remove the outer layer that may have been contaminated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fruits to Avoid:</strong> Be cautious with fruits that you eat whole, like berries, grapes, or apples, unless you can wash them yourself thoroughly with purified water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Pre-Cut Fruit:</strong> Decline pre-cut fruit salads from street vendors or buffets, as you don't know when they were cut or how they were washed.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Excessive drinking impairs your judgment and makes you vulnerable to crime, accidents, and scams.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Know Your Travel Limits:</strong> Your usual alcohol tolerance can be significantly lower when you are affected by jet lag, dehydration, or altitude. Drink less than you would at home.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay in Control:</strong> Your judgment is your most important safety tool. Never drink to the point where you lose awareness of your surroundings or your ability to make smart decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Alternate with Water:</strong> For every alcoholic beverage you have, drink a full glass of water. This keeps you hydrated and slows down your alcohol consumption.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Accepting drinks from strangers, no matter how friendly they seem, puts you at serious risk of drink spiking.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Buy Your Own Drinks:</strong> Make it a strict rule to always buy your own drinks and watch the bartender prepare them from start to finish.</li>
                        <li><strong>Be Wary of Overly Insistent Offers:</strong> While some people are genuinely friendly, be cautious of anyone who is aggressively insistent on buying you a drink, especially if you've just met.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recognize the Danger:</strong> Drink spiking is a real and common crime used to facilitate robbery or sexual assault. This rule is non-negotiable.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Leaving your drink unattended, even for a moment, gives someone an opportunity to spike it with drugs or other substances.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>The Bathroom Rule:</strong> If you need to use the restroom, either finish your drink before you go or abandon it and buy a new one when you return.</li>
                        <li><strong>On the Dance Floor:</strong> Don't leave your drink at a table while you dance. Take it with you or go without.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trust No One (with your drink):</strong> Do not even ask a new acquaintance to watch your drink for you. It's not worth the risk.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Drinking too much makes you an easy target and puts you in dangerous situations you can't handle properly.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Understand Affecting Factors:</strong> Travel fatigue, dehydration, and altitude can all dramatically lower your alcohol tolerance. One drink might feel like two.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set a Hard Limit:</strong> Before you start drinking, decide on a maximum number of drinks for the evening and stick to it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emergency Planning:</strong> Before you have your first drink, ensure you have a solid plan for getting back to your accommodation safely, including having enough cash for a taxi.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Proper hydration is especially critical when traveling, as dehydration affects judgment, energy levels, and physical ability.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Drink Proactively:</strong> Don't wait until you feel thirsty. Sip water consistently throughout the day, especially in hot climates or at high altitudes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor Yourself:</strong> A good indicator of hydration is your urine color. It should be light yellow. If it's dark, you need to drink more water immediately.</li>
                        <li><strong>Carry Your Own Bottle:</strong> Bring a reusable water bottle and fill it with purified or bottled water. This ensures you always have safe water on hand.</li>
