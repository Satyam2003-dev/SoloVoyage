                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Solo travelers face different safety concerns than couples or groups, so seek out reviews from people in similar situations.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Filter for Solo Travelers:</strong> When browsing hotels or hostels, use the review filters to see comments specifically from solo travelers, and especially solo female travelers if applicable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for Safety Keywords:</strong> Search reviews for terms like "safe neighborhood," "security," "locks," "staff," and "front desk" to gauge the safety of the property.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heed the Warnings:</strong> Pay close attention to recurring themes in negative reviews. One person's bad experience might be an anomaly; several people reporting the same issue is a major red flag.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Having staff available at all times provides security and assistance when you need it most.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>A Human Deterrent:</strong> The presence of staff at the entrance is a powerful deterrent to non-guests and potential criminals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emergency Resource:</strong> If you face any issue, from a medical problem to feeling unsafe, having immediate access to a staff member is crucial.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verify the Service:</strong> Before booking, confirm that "24-hour service" means a person is physically at the desk, not just available via an emergency phone number.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Assess the security measures of a property before you book and verify them upon arrival.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Key Features to Look For:</strong> Seek out properties with key card access (not traditional keys), security cameras in common areas, well-lit hallways and entrances, and in-room safes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Upon Arrival Inspection:</strong> When you get to your room, immediately check that all locks on doors and windows are functioning properly. Locate the nearest fire exit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't Hesitate to Leave:</strong> If the security feels inadequate or you feel unsafe for any reason, it is perfectly acceptable to leave and find another place to stay.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Ground floor rooms are more accessible from the outside, making them easier targets for break-ins.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Request a Higher Floor:</strong> When booking or checking in, request a room on the second or third floor. This is high enough to be secure but low enough for a quick exit in an emergency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assess Accessibility:</strong> Avoid rooms with windows or sliding doors that open directly onto parking lots, dark alleys, or secluded courtyards.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ground Floor Precautions:</strong> If you must stay on the ground floor, keep your curtains closed at all times, double-check that every lock is engaged, and consider a portable door wedge or alarm for extra security.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Always check the security of your room immediately upon arrival, before you even unpack your bags.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Full Lock Check:</strong> Physically test the main door lock, the deadbolt, the security chain, and any latches. Ensure the door closes securely and the frame is solid. Check that the peephole is clear.</li>
                        <li><strong>Window Security:</strong> Test every single window lock, including those on balconies. Confirm they cannot be easily opened from the outside.</li>
                        <li><strong>Demand a Secure Room:</strong> If any lock is broken, do not accept the room. Insist on a room change or find another hotel. Your safety is non-negotiable.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Even in hotels with modern key card access, you should use every single locking mechanism available to you.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Always Engage:</strong> The moment you enter your room, make it a habit to engage the deadbolt and the security chain or latch. Do this every single time without fail.</li>
                        <li><strong>Responding to Knocks:</strong> If someone knocks, use the peephole first. If they claim to be staff, call the front desk to verify before even unlatching the chain.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bring Your Own:</strong> For extra peace of mind, consider packing a lightweight portable door lock or a rubber doorstop wedge. These can provide an extra layer of security.</li>

                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Discreet Check-In:</strong> If a front desk clerk announces your room number loudly, politely ask them to write it down for you instead. You never know who is listening in the lobby.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deflect Questions:</strong> Never tell a stranger, a new acquaintance, or a taxi driver your room number. If they need to contact you, they can do so through the front desk.</li>
                        <li><strong>Memorize and Discard:</strong> Memorize your room number immediately and discard or hide the key card sleeve that has it written on it. Don't leave it lying around.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Hotel safes provide secure storage for items you don't need to carry with you while exploring.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>What to Store:</strong> Use the safe for your passport (carry a photocopy with you), extra cash, backup credit cards, and any expensive electronics you leave behind.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set a Unique Code:</strong> Choose a personal code that is not obvious (avoid "1234" or your birthday). Test the safe to make sure it locks and unlocks correctly before putting your items inside.</li>
                        <li><strong>Front Desk Safes:</strong> If your room does not have a safe, ask if the hotel has safe deposit boxes at the front desk. These are often even more secure.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Familiarize yourself with emergency procedures and exit routes as soon as you settle into your room.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Study the Map:</strong> Look at the fire escape plan posted on the back of your door. Don't just look at it—actually walk the route to the nearest two emergency exits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Count the Doors:</strong> Count the number of doors between your room and the nearest exit. In a fire, smoke can make it impossible to see, and you may need to navigate by touch.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan Your Escape:</strong> In an emergency, never use the elevator. Know where the stairwells are. Have a plan for grabbing your most essential items (passport, phone, wallet) in seconds.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Never open your hotel room door for anyone you don't know or weren't expecting. This is an absolute rule with no exceptions.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Use the Peephole:</strong> This is what it's for. Always look through the peephole to identify who is at your door before considering any other action.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verify All Staff:</strong> If someone claims to be from hotel maintenance, housekeeping, or room service (that you didn't order), call the front desk from your room phone to confirm their identity and purpose. Do not open the door until you have verified.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trust Your Gut:</strong> If a person's presence at your door feels suspicious, or if they are being pushy, do not engage. Call hotel security or the front desk immediately and report it.</li>
