                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Rushing through airports increases stress and the likelihood of making safety mistakes or forgetting important items.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Plan for Delays:</strong> Arrive at least 3 hours early for international flights and 2 for domestic. This gives you a buffer for long lines or unexpected issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduce Stress:</strong> Use the extra time to relax, eat a proper meal, charge your devices, and double-check your documents. A calm traveler is an aware traveler.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Vulnerability:</strong> Scammers and thieves often target travelers who look stressed, rushed, and distracted. Don't be one of them.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Never put important or valuable items in checked baggage, which can be lost, stolen, or damaged.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Essential Carry-On Items:</strong> Your passport, all money and credit cards, prescription medications, phone, laptop, camera, and a copy of your documents must stay with you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assume the Worst:</strong> Always pack your carry-on as if your checked bag will be lost. Include a change of clothes and basic toiletries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure Your Carry-On:</strong> Keep your bag with you at all times in the airport and on the plane. Never leave it unattended, even for a second.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Avoid unmarked taxis, people who approach you inside the terminal offering rides, or vehicles that don't look like legitimate taxis.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Find the Official Stand:</strong> At airports and train stations, look for the official, marked taxi stand. Ignore solicitors who approach you directly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify a Real Taxi:</strong> Look for proper licensing, a working meter, and official company names and numbers displayed on the vehicle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Share Your Ride Details:</strong> Before getting in, take a quick photo of the license plate and driver's ID number and send it to a trusted contact.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Pre-arranged transportation is almost always safer than figuring out options when you arrive tired and disoriented.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Reputable Companies:</strong> Book through your hotel or a well-reviewed, official shuttle or car service company online before your trip.</li>
                        <li><strong>Confirm Details:</strong> Get a confirmation number, the driver's contact info, and the exact pickup location. A legitimate service will often ask for your flight number to track delays.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Scams:</strong> Having a pre-booked ride helps you confidently bypass the often chaotic and scam-filled arrivals hall transportation scrum.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>A charged phone is essential for navigation, communication, emergencies, and accessing important information.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Charge at Every Opportunity:</strong> Fully charge your devices before leaving for the airport. Use charging stations during layovers. Keep your portable power bank topped up.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manage Battery Life:</strong> Use power-saving modes, dim your screen, and close unnecessary apps to conserve battery during long travel days.</li>
                        <li><strong>Have Non-Tech Backups:</strong> Despite your best efforts, phones can fail. Have your hotel address and key phone numbers written down on paper as a fail-safe.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Keeping your solo travel status private reduces your vulnerability to scams, theft, and other dangers.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Prepare a Vague Story:</strong> When asked, have a simple, believable story. You are "meeting friends," "visiting family," or "my partner is arriving tomorrow."</li>
                        <li><strong>Deflect Personal Questions:</strong> Be wary of anyone, including overly friendly taxi drivers or locals, who asks too many questions about your plans, where you are staying, or for how long.</li>
                        <li><strong>Project Confidence:</strong> It's a small, white lie for your safety. State your story confidently and change the subject.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Never leave your bags, electronics, or valuables unattended, not even for a moment.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>The Restroom Rule:</strong> When using a public restroom, take all of your belongings into the stall with you. Do not ask a stranger to watch your things.</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical Contact:</strong> When sitting in a cafe or waiting area, keep your bag on your lap or loop a strap around your leg. Don't just place it on the floor or an empty chair beside you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Be Aware of Distraction Theft:</strong> Be extra vigilant if someone creates a commotion or spills something on you; it's a common tactic for an accomplice to steal your bag while you're distracted.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Airports can be confusing, and exhaustion during a long layover can make you vulnerable.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Confirm Your Next Gate:</strong> As soon as you land, find a departure board and confirm the gate and time for your connecting flight. Gates can change.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set Multiple Alarms:</strong> If you plan to rest or sleep, set multiple alarms on your phone and watch to ensure you don't miss your flight.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay in Secure Areas:</strong> Remain past the security checkpoint. The "airside" of an airport is generally safer than the "landside" public areas.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>Travel dehydration and poor nutrition can severely affect your judgment, energy, and ability to handle stressful situations.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Hydration is Key:</strong> Airplane cabin air is extremely dry. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your flight. Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, which are dehydrating.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintain Energy Levels:</strong> Eat proper meals to keep your blood sugar stable. Pack healthy snacks like nuts or protein bars for long travel days to avoid energy crashes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Boost Your Immunity:</strong> Being tired and run-down makes you more susceptible to getting sick. Prioritizing hydration and nutrition helps keep your immune system strong.</li>

                    <p class="tip-intro"><strong>While rest is important, you must balance it with security, especially when surrounded by strangers.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="tip-bullets">
                        <li><strong>Secure Your Valuables:</strong> Before you doze off, ensure your most important items (passport, wallet, phone) are secured in a money belt or in a zipped inside pocket, not in the seat-back pocket.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Your Bag as a Pillow:</strong> Use your carry-on bag or backpack as a pillow or footrest. The physical contact will make it more likely you'll wake up if someone tries to move it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Choose Your Seat Wisely:</strong> A window seat is often more secure for sleeping, as you can lean against the wall and are less exposed to traffic in the aisle.</li>
